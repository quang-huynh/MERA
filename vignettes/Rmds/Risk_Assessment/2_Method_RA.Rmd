## Running a risk assessment

Running the risk assessment is straightforward. An operating model is constructed directly from the questionnaire and future projections are carried out for 

* 196 simulations 
* for a standard 50 year projection 
* for 4 alternative management scenarios: status quo fishing effort, status quo annual catches, zero catch and fishing exactly at FMSY. 

Since it involves a relatively large number of simulations, the risk assessment can take a couple of minutes to run.
