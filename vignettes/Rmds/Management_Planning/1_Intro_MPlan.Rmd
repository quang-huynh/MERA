## Background to management planning  

Given what is currently known (and not known) about a stock, its fishery and research program:

* what management approach is likely to best achieve management objectives (MP selection)? 
* what data collection processes are most important in determining management performance (Value of information)?
* which current uncertainties have the greatest influence of management performance (Cost of current uncertainties)?

Management Planning is the most complex use-case of MERA and provides closed-loop simulation testing of numerous management procedures and diagnostics to help managers identify research priorities.
