## Running a Status Determination

In the options panel of the MERA questionnaire there is the option to load fishery data. These data can include time series of relative abundance indices, mean length and catch data. 

Once loaded status determination can be run - this automatically detects which status determination methods are possible given the uploaded data and conducts a simulation test to evaluate their potential accuracy and precision over a range of simulated depletion levels.
